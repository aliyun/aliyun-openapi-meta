If you set this parameter to true, when the requested resource matches the resource in the range that corresponds to the type of the purge task, the POP retrieves the resource from the origin server, returns the resource to the client, and caches the resource.\n*   **false**: purges the changed resources in the range that corresponds to the type of the purge task. If you set this parameter to false, when the requested resource matches the resource in the range that corresponds to the type of the purge task, the POP obtains the Last-Modified parameter of the resource from the origin server. If the obtained value of the Last-Modified parameter is the same as that of the cached resource, the cached resource is returned. Otherwise, the POP retrieves the resource from the origin server, returns the resource to the client, and caches the resource.\n\n>  This parameter takes effect only when the ObjectType parameter is not set to File.",
