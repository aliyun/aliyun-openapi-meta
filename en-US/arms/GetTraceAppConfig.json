In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Application Monitoring** > **Application List**. On the Application List page, click the name of your application. The URL in the address bar contains the PID of the application. The PID is indicated in the pid=xxx format. The PID is usually percent encoded as xxx%40xxx. You must modify this value to remove the percent encoding. For example, if the PID in the URL is xxx%4074xxx, you must replace %40 with an at sign (@) to obtain xxx@74xxx.\n\n> \n\n*   To obtain the PID in the console, your application must be monitored by Application Monitoring rather than Managed Service for OpenTelemetry.\n\n*   The GetTraceAppConfig operation can query only the custom settings of applications that are monitored by Application Monitoring.",
