If EipBindMode is set to NAT when the NAT gateway is created, you cannot change the value of this parameter from **NAT** to **MULTI_BINDED**. For more information about **MULTI_BINDED**, see [CreateNatGateway](~~120219~~).\n\n*   When the mode in which the NAT gateway is associated with an EIP is being changed, a transient connection that lasts a few seconds may occur. If the number of EIPs with which the NAT gateway is associated increases, the transient connection lasts longer. You can change the mode only for a NAT gateway that is associated with up to five EIPs. We recommend that you change the mode during off-peak hours.\n*   After the mode is changed to **NAT**, the Internet NAT gateway is compatible with the IPv4 gateway. However, if you associate an EIP with the NAT gateway, the EIP occupies one private IP address on the vSwitch of the NAT gateway. Make sure that the vSwitch has sufficient private IP addresses. Otherwise, the EIP fails to be associated with the NAT gateway.",
