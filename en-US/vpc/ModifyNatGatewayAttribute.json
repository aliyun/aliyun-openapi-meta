For more information about the **MULTI_BINDED** mode, see [CreateNatGateway](~~120219~~).\n\n*   When you change the association mode, your network may be interrupted for seconds. The duration increases with the number of EIPs. You can change the association mode for at most 5 EIPs at the same time. We recommend changing the association mode during off-peak hours.\n*   After the association mode is changed to **NAT**, the Internet NAT gateway is compatible with an IPv4 gateway. If an EIP is associated with a NAT gateway in NAT mode, the EIP occupies a private IP address of the vSwitch to which the NAT gateway belongs. Ensure the vSwitch has sufficient private IP addresses for EIPs to be associated with the NAT gateway.",
