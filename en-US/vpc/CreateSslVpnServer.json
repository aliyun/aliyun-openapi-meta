The encryption algorithm that you specify for the SSL server does not take effect.\n\n*   If the client uses OpenVPN of a version that is earlier than 2.4.0, the SSL server and the client use the encryption algorithm that you specify for the SSL server. You can specify one of the following encryption algorithms for the SSL server:\n\n    *   **AES-128-CBC** (default)\n    *   **AES-192-CBC**\n    *   **AES-256-CBC**\n    *   **none**",

      "description": "The client CIDR block.\n\nThe CIDR block from which an IP address is allocated to the virtual network interface controller (NIC) of the client, rather than the private CIDR block.\n\nIf the client accesses the SSL server over an SSL-VPN connection, the VPN gateway assigns an IP address from the specified client CIDR block for the client to access cloud resources.\n\nMake sure that the number of IP addresses in the client CIDR block is at least four times the maximum number of SSL-VPN connections supported by the VPN gateway.\n\n**Click to view the reason.**\n\nFor example, if you specify 192.168.0.0/24 as the client CIDR block, the system first divides a subnet CIDR block with a subnet mask of 30 from 192.168.0.0/24, such as 192.168.0.4/30. This subnet provides up to four IP addresses. Then, the system allocates an IP address from 192.168.0.4/30 to the client and uses the other three IP addresses to ensure network communication. In this case, one client consumes four IP addresses. Therefore, to ensure that an IP address is assigned to your client, the number of IP addresses in the client CIDR block must be at least four times the maximum number of SSL-VPN connections supported by the VPN gateway with which the SSL server is associated.\n\n**Click to view the CIDR blocks that are not supported.**\n\n*   100.64.0.0~100.127.255.255\n*   127.0.0.0~127.255.255.255\n*   169.254.0.0~169.254.255.255\n*   224.0.0.0~239.255.255.255\n*   255.0.0.0~255.255.255.255\n\n**Click to view the recommended client CIDR blocks for different numbers of SSL-VPN connections.**\n\n*   If the number of SSL-VPN connections is 5, we recommend that you specify a client CIDR block with a subnet mask that is less than or equal to 27 bits in length. Examples: 10.0.0.0/27 and 10.0.0.0/26.\n*   If the number of SSL-VPN connections is 10, we recommend that you specify a client CIDR block with a subnet mask that is less than or equal to 26 bits in length. Examples: 10.0.0.0/26 and 10.0.0.0/25.\n*   If the number of SSL-VPN connections is 20, we recommend that you specify a client CIDR block with a subnet mask that is less than or equal to 25 bits in length. Examples: 10.0.0.0/25 and 10.0.0.0/24.\n*   If the number of SSL-VPN connections is 50, we recommend that you specify a client CIDR block with a subnet mask that is less than or equal to 24 bits in length. Examples: 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/23.\n*   If the number of SSL-VPN connections is 100, we recommend that you specify a client CIDR block with a subnet mask that is less than or equal to 23 bits in length. Examples: 10.0.0.0/23 and 10.0.0.0/22.\n*   If the number of SSL-VPN connections is 200, we recommend that you specify a client CIDR block with a subnet mask that is less than or equal to 22 bits in length. Examples: 10.0.0.0/22 and 10.0.0.0/21.\n*   If the number of SSL-VPN connections is 500, we recommend that you specify a client CIDR block with a subnet mask that is less than or equal to 21 bits in length. Examples: 10.0.0.0/21 and 10.0.0.0/20.\n*   If the number of SSL-VPN connections is 1,000, we recommend that you specify a client CIDR block with a subnet mask that is less than or equal to 20 bits in length. Examples: 10.0.0.0/20 and 10.0.0.0/19.\n\n> \n\n*   The subnet mask of the client CIDR block must be 16 to 29 bits in length.\n\n*   Make sure that the client CIDR block does not overlap with the local CIDR block, the VPC CIDR block, or route CIDR blocks associated with the client.\n\n*   We recommend that you use 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, or one of their subnets as the client CIDR block. If you want to specify a public CIDR block as the client CIDR block, you must specify the public CIDR block as the user CIDR block of the virtual private cloud (VPC). This way, the VPC can access the public CIDR block. For more information, see [VPC FAQs](~~185311~~).\n\n*   After you create an SSL server, the system automatically adds routes that point to the client CIDR block to the VPC route table. Do not manually add routes that point to the client CIDR block. Otherwise, SSL-VPN connections cannot work as expected.",
