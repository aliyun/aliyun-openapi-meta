The JSON struct contains the following fields:\n\n*   **ProxyMode**: The load balancing algorithm for back-to-origin traffic. This field is required and must be a string. Valid values:\n\n    *   **ip_hash**: the IP hash algorithm. This algorithm is used to redirect the requests from the same IP address to the same origin server.\n    *   **rr**: the round-robin algorithm. This algorithm is used to redirect requests to origin servers in turn. If you use this algorithm, you can specify a weight for each server based on server performance.\n    *   **least_time**: the least response time algorithm. This algorithm is used to minimize the latency when requests are forwarded from Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium instances to origin servers based on the intelligent DNS resolution feature.\n\n*   **Attributes**: the parameters for back-to-origin. This field is optional and must be a JSON array. Each element in the array contains the following fields:\n\n    *   **RealServer**: the address of the origin server. This field is optional and must be a string.\n\n    *   **Attribute**: the parameter for back-to-origin. This field is optional and must be a JSON object. The value contains the following field:\n\n        *   **Weight**: the weight of the server. This field is optional and must be an integer. This field takes effect only when **ProxyMode** is set to **rr**. Valid values: **1** to **100**. Default value: **100**. An origin server with a higher weight receives more requests.",
