      "description": "The back-to-origin policy. The value is a string that consists of a JSON struct. The JSON struct contains the following fields:\n\n*   **ProxyMode**: The load balancing algorithm for back-to-origin traffic. This field is required and must be a string. Valid values:\n\n    *   **ip_hash**: the IP hash algorithm. This algorithm is used to redirect requests from the same IP address to the same origin server.\n    *   **rr**: the round-robin algorithm. This algorithm is used to redirect requests to origin servers in turn. If you use this algorithm, you can specify a weight for each server based on server performance.\n    *   **least_time**: the least response time algorithm. This algorithm is used to minimize the latency when requests are forwarded from the instance to origin servers based on the intelligent DNS resolution feature.\n\n*   **Attributes**: the parameters for back-to-origin processing. This field is optional and must be a JSON array. Each element in the array contains the following fields:\n\n    *   **RealServer**: the address of the origin server. This field is optional and must be a string.\n\n    *   **Attribute**: the parameter for back-to-origin processing. This field is optional and must be a JSON object. Valid values:\n\n        *   **Weight**: the weight of the server. This field is optional and must be an integer. This field takes effect only when **ProxyMode** is set to **rr**. Valid values: **1** to **100**. Default value: **100**. An origin server with a higher weight receives more requests.\n        *   **ConnectTimeout**: the timeout period for new connections. This field is optional and must be an integer. Valid values: **1** to **10**. Unit: seconds. Default value: **5**.\n        *   **FailTimeout**: the period after which a connection is considered to have failed. This field is optional and must be an integer. Valid values: **1** to **3600**. Unit: seconds. Default value: **10**.\n        *   **MaxFails**: the maximum number of failures allowed. This field is related to health checks. This field is optional and must be an integer. Valid values: **1** to **10**. Unit: seconds. Default value: **3**.\n        *   **Mode**: the primary/secondary attribute flag. This parameter is optional and must be a string. Valid values: **active** (primary) and **backup** (secondary).\n        *   **ReadTimeout**: the read timeout period. This field is optional and must be an integer. Valid values: **10** to **300**. Unit: seconds. Default value: **120**.\n        *   **SendTimeout**: the write timeout period. This field is optional and must be an integer. Valid values: **10** to **300**. Unit: seconds.
