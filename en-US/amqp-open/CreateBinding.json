One or more key-value pairs can be concatenated to configure the headers attributes of a message. You must specify the x-match attribute as one of the valid values. You can specify custom values for other attributes. Valid values of the x-match attribute:\n\n*   \\*\\*all: \\*\\*A headers exchange routes a message to a queue only if all binding attributes of the queue except for x-match match the headers attributes of the message. This value is the default value.\n*   \\*\\*any: \\*\\*A headers exchange routes a message to a queue if one or more binding attributes of the queue except for x-match match the headers attributes of the message.\n\nSeparate the attributes with semicolons (;). Separate the key and value of an attribute with a colon (:). Example: x-match:all;type:report;format:pdf. This parameter is available for only headers exchanges. You can set this parameter to an arbitrary value for other types of exchanges.",
