If the address with the smaller sequence number is unavailable, the next address with a smaller sequence number is returned.\n- weight: Weighted, supports setting different weight values for each address, realizing the return of addresses according to the weight ratio for resolution queries.\n- source_nearest: Source-nearest, i.e., intelligent resolution function, where GTM can return different addresses based on the source of different DNS resolution requests, achieving the effect of users accessing nearby.",
