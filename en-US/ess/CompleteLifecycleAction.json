Valid values:\n\n*   CONTINUE: Auto Scaling continues to respond to a scale-in or scale-out request.\n*   ABANDON: Auto Scaling releases Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances that are created during scale-out activities or removes ECS instances from the scaling group during scale-in activities.\n*   ROLLBACK: For scale-in activities, Auto Scaling rejects the requests to release ECS instances but rolls back ECS instances. For scale-out activities, the ROLLBACK setting has the same effect as the ABANDON setting.\n\nIf you do not specify this parameter, Auto Scaling performs the action that is specified by the `DefaultResult` parameter after the lifecycle hook times out.\n\nIf multiple lifecycle hooks exist in a scaling group and the lifecycle hooks are triggered at the same time, the following rules apply:\n\n*   For scale-in activities, when lifecycle hooks whose LifecycleActionResult parameter is set to `ABANDON` or `ROLLBACK` time out, other lifecycle hooks time out ahead of schedule.\n*   For scale-in and scale-out activities, if you set the LifecycleActionResult parameter for all lifecycle hooks to `CONTINUE`, Auto Scaling performs the subsequent action only after the last lifecycle hook times out. The action that is performed by Auto Scaling varies based on the value that you specified for the LifecycleActionResult parameter of the last lifecycle hook that times out.",
