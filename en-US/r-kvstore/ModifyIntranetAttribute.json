The bandwidth is also subject to the following limits:\n\n*   The bandwidth of an individual instance cannot exceed 75% of the bandwidth of the host. For more information about the host specifications and bandwidth, see [Instance types of hosts](~~206343~~).\n*   The total bandwidth of all of the instances on the host cannot exceed 150% of the bandwidth of the host. You can configure resource overcommitment to handle traffic spikes. For more information, see [Configure resource overcommitment to reduce costs](~~183798~~).\n\n> If you do not specify this parameter for a standard instance, the bandwidth of the instance is set to two times that of the current bandwidth.",
