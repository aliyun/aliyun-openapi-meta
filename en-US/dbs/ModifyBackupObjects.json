      "description": "The backup objects, specified as a JSON string. The structure is as follows:\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"DBName\":\"The name of the database to back up\",\n        \"SchemaName\":\"The name of the schema to back up\",\n        \"TableIncludes\":[{\n        \t\"TableName\":\"The name of the table to back up\"\n        }],\n        \"TableExcludes\":[{\n            \"TableName\":\"The name of a table in the database that you do not want to back up\"\n        }]\n    }\n]\n```\n\n- If you specify only `DBName` without configuring rules for sub-objects, all objects in the database are backed up.\n\n- If you specify `DBName` and configure rules for some objects, any objects without configured rules are not backed up by default. The following regular expressions are supported for defining object names:\n\n  - A period (`.`) matches any single character except `\r\n`.\n\n  - An asterisk (`*`) matches the preceding subexpression zero or more times. For example, `h*llo` matches `hllo` and `heeeello`.\n\n  - A question mark (`?`) matches the preceding subexpression zero or one time. For example, `h.?llo` matches `hllo` and `hello`, but not `haello`.\n\n  - A character set `[characters]` matches any single character within the brackets. For example, `h[aello]` matches `hallo` and `hello`.\n\n  - A negated character set `[^characters]` matches any single character not within the brackets. For example, `h[^ae]llo` matches `hcllo` and `hdllo`, but not `hallo` or `hello`.\n\n  - A character range `[character1-character2]` matches any character within the specified range, such as `[0-9]` or `[a-z]`.\n\n> `SchemaName` and `NewSchemaName` are used only for SQL Server. For other database engines, use `DBName` and `NewDBName` to specify database names.",
