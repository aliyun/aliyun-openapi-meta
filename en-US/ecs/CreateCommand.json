Take note of the following items:\n\n*   The value must be Base64-encoded and cannot exceed 18 KB in size.\n\n*   You can use custom parameters in the command content. To enable the custom parameter feature, you must set `EnableParameter` to true.\n\n    *   Custom parameters are defined in the `{{}}` format. Within `{{}}`, the spaces and line feeds before and after the parameter names are ignored.\n    *   You can specify up to 20 custom parameters.\n    *   A custom parameter name can contain only letters, digits, underscores (\\_), and hyphens (-). The name is case-insensitive. The ACS:: prefix cannot be used to specify non-built-in environment parameters.\n    *   Each custom parameter name can be up to 64 bytes in length.\n\n*   You can specify built-in environment parameters as custom parameters in a command. When you run the command, Cloud Assistant automatically uses the environment parameter values for the custom parameters. You can specify the following built-in environment variables:\n\n    *   `{{ACS::RegionId}}`: the region ID.\n\n    *   `{{ACS::AccountId}}`: the UID of the Alibaba Cloud account.\n\n    *   `{{ACS::InstanceId}}`: the instance ID. If you want to run the command on multiple instances and specify `{{ACS::InstanceId}}` as a built-in environment parameter, make sure that the Cloud Assistant Agent version is not earlier than the following versions:\n\n        *   Linux: 2.2.3.309\n        *   Windows: 2.1.3.309\n\n    *   `{{ACS::InstanceName}}`: the instance name. If you want to run the command on multiple instances and specify `{{ACS::InstanceName}}` as a built-in environment parameter, make sure that the Cloud Assistant Agent version is not earlier than the following versions:\n\n        *   Linux: 2.2.3.344\n        *   Windows: 2.1.3.344\n\n    *   `{{ACS::InvokeId}}`: the ID of the task. If you want to specify `{{ACS::InvokeId}}` as a built-in environment parameter, make sure that the Cloud Assistant Agent version is not earlier than the following versions:\n\n        *   Linux: 2.2.3.309\n        *   Windows: 2.1.3.309\n\n    *   `{{ACS::CommandId}}`: the command ID. If you want to call the [RunCommand](~~141751~~) operation to run the command and specify `{{ACS::CommandId}}` as a built-in environment parameter, make sure that the Cloud Assistant Agent version is not earlier than the following versions:\n\n        *   Linux: 2.2.3.309\n        *   Windows: 2.1.3.309",
