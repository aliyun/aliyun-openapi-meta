      "description": "The schedule on which to run the command. You can configure a command to run at a fixed interval based on a rate expression, run only once at a specific time, or run at specific times based on a cron expression.\n\n*   To run a command at a fixed interval, use a rate expression to specify the interval. You can specify the interval in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. This option is suitable for scenarios in which tasks need to be executed at a fixed interval. Specify the interval in the following format: `rate(<Execution interval value><Execution interval unit>)`. For example, specify `rate(5m)` to run the command every 5 minutes. When you specify an interval, take note of the following limits:\n\n    *   The interval can be anywhere from 60 seconds to 7 days, but must be longer than the timeout period of the scheduled task.\n    *   The interval is the amount of time that elapses between two consecutive executions. The interval is irrelevant to the amount of time that is required to run the command once. For example, assume that you set the interval to 5 minutes and that it takes 2 minutes to run the command each time. Each time the command is run, the system waits 3 minutes before the system runs the command again.\n    *   A task is not immediately executed after the task is created. For example, assume that you set the interval to 5 minutes for a task. The task begins to be executed 5 minutes after it is created.\n\n*   To run a command only once at a specific time, specify a point in time and a time zone. Specify the point in time in the `at(yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss <Time zone>)` format, which indicates `at(Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second <Time zone>)`. If you do not specify a time zone, the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone is used by default. You can specify a time zone in the following forms:\n\n    *   The time zone name. Examples: `Asia/Shanghai` and `America/Los_Angeles`.\n    *   The time offset from GMT. Examples: `GMT+8:00` (UTC+8) and `GMT-7:00` (UTC-7). If you use the GMT format, you cannot add leading zeros to the hour value.\n    *   The time zone abbreviation. Only UTC is supported.\n\n    For example, to configure a command to run only once at 13:15:30 on June 6, 2022 (Shanghai time), set the time to `at(2022-06-06 13:15:30 Asia/Shanghai)`. To configure a command to run only once at 13:15:30 on June 6, 2022 (UTC-7), set the time to `at(2022-06-06 13:15:30 GMT-7:00)`.\n\n*   To run a command at specific times, use a cron expression to define the schedule. Specify a schedule in the `<Cron expression> <Time zone>` format. The cron expression is in the `<seconds> <minutes> <hours> <day of the month> <month> <day of the week> <year (optional)>` format. The system calculates the execution times of the command based on the specified cron expression and time zone and runs the command as scheduled. If you do not specify a time zone, the system time zone of the instance on which you want to run the command is used by default. For more information about cron expressions, see [Cron expressions](~~64769~~). You can specify a time zone in the following forms:\n\n    *   The time zone name. Examples: `Asia/Shanghai` and `America/Los_Angeles`.\n    *   The time offset from GMT. Examples: `GMT+8:00` (UTC+8) and `GMT-7:00` (UTC-7). If you use the GMT format, you cannot add leading zeros to the hour value.\n    *   The time zone abbreviation. Only UTC is supported. For example, to configure a command to run at 10:15:00 every day in 2022 (Shanghai time), set the schedule to `0 15 10 ? * * 2022 Asia/Shanghai`. To configure a command to run every half an hour from 10:00:00 to 11:30:00 every day in 2022 (UTC+8), set the schedule to `0 0/30 10-11 * * ? 2022 GMT+8:00`. To configure a command to run every 5 minutes from 14:00:00 to 14:55:00 every October every two years from 2022 in UTC, set the schedule to `0 0/5 14 * 10 ? 2022/2 UTC`.\n\n    **\n\n    **Note** The minimum interval must be 10 seconds or more and cannot be shorter than the timeout period of scheduled executions.",
