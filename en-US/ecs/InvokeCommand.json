      "description": "The schedule based on which you want to run the command. This parameter is required if you set `Timed` to `true`. You can configure a command to run at a fixed interval based on a rate expression, run only once at a specified point in time, or run at designated points in time based on a cron expression.\n\n*   To run a command at a fixed interval, use a rate expression to specify the interval. You can specify the interval in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. This option is applicable when tasks need to be executed at a fixed interval. Specify the interval in the following format: `rate(<Running interval value><Running interval unit>)`. For example, specify `rate(5m)` to run the command every 5 minutes. Take note of the following limits when you specify an interval:\n\n    *   The specified interval can range from 60 seconds to 7 days and must be longer than the timeout period of the scheduled task.\n    *   The interval is the duration between two consecutive executions. The interval is irrelevant to the amount of time required to run the command once. For example, if you set the interval to 5 minutes and 2 minutes are required to run the command each time. Each time the command is run, the system waits 3 minutes before it runs the command again.\n    *   A task is not run immediately after it is created. For example, if you set the interval to 5 minutes and create a task to run the command. The task begins to run 5 minutes after it is created.\n\n*   To run a command only once at a specified point in time, specify a point in time and a time zone. Specify the point in time in the following format: `at(yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss <Time zone>)`, which indicates `at(Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second <Time zone>)`. If you do not specify a time zone, the UTC time zone is used by default. You can specify the time zone in the following forms:\n\n    *   The time zone name. Examples: `Asia/Shanghai` and `America/Los_Angeles`.\n    *   The time offset from GMT. Examples: `GMT+8:00` (UTC+8) and `GMT-7:00` (UTC-7). If you use the GMT format, do not pad leading zeros to the hour value.\n    *   The time zone abbreviation. Only UTC is supported.\n\n    For example, to configure a command to run only once at 13:15:30 on June 06, 2022 (Shanghai time), set the time to `at(2022-06-06 13:15:30 Asia/Shanghai)`. To configure a command to run only once at 13:15:30 on June 06, 2022 (UTC-7), set the time to `at(2022-06-06 13:15:30 GMT-7:00)`.\n\n*   To run a command at designated points in time, specify a cron expression. Specify the time in the following format: `<Cron expression> <Time zone>`, where the cron expression is in the format of `<seconds> <minutes> <hours> <day of the month> <month> <day of the week> <year (optional)>`. The system calculates the execution times of the command based on the specified cron expression and time zone and runs the command as scheduled. If you do not specify a time zone, the system time zone of the instance on which to run the command is used by default. For more information about cron expressions, see [Cron expressions](~~64769~~). You can specify the time zone in the following forms:\n\n    *   The time zone name. Examples: `Asia/Shanghai` and `America/Los_Angeles`.\n    *   The time offset from GMT. Examples: `GMT+8:00` (UTC+8) and `GMT-7:00` (UTC-7). If you use the GMT format, do not pad leading zeros to the hour value.\n    *   The time zone abbreviation. Only UTC is supported.\n\n    For example, to configure a command to run at 10:15:00 every day in 2022 (Shanghai time), set the time to `0 15 10 ? * * 2022 Asia/Shanghai`. To configure a command to run every half an hour from 10:00:00 to 11:30:00 every day in 2022 (UTC+8), set the time to `0 0/30 10-11 * * ? 2022 GMT +8:00`. To configure a command to run every 5 minutes from 14:00:00 to 14:55:00 every October every two years since 2022 (UTC), set the time to `0 0/5 14 * 10 ? 2022/2 UTC`.\n\n    **\n\n    **Note**The minimum interval must be 10 seconds or more and cannot be shorter than the timeout period of scheduled executions.",
