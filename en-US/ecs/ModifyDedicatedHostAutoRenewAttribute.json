When the subscription ECS instances hosted on your dedicated hosts are automatically renewed, the subscription dedicated hosts are also automatically renewed if the expiration time of the dedicated hosts is earlier than the expiration time of the renewed instances. Take note of the following items:\n\nWhen the subscription dedicated hosts are configured to be automatically renewed along with the subscription ECS instances hosted on the dedicated hosts, the system checks the expiration time of the renewed instances and selects a minimum renewal duration for the dedicated hosts so that the dedicated hosts are renewed by a duration that ends later than the expiration time of the renewed instances. For more information about supported renewal durations, see the descriptions of the `PeriodUnit` and `Duration` parameters.\n\nFor example, assume that a dedicated host expires on January 15 of the current year. Subscription ECS instances hosted on the dedicated host are configured to be automatically renewed to November 15 of the same year. The expiration time of the dedicated host is earlier than the expiration time of the ECS instances by 10 months. In this case, the system selects a renewal duration of 12 months (a minimum duration calculated based on a `Duration` value of 12 and a `PeriodUnit` value of Month) for the dedicated host. This ensures that the dedicated host expires later than the ECS instances.\n\nValid values:\n\n*   AutoRenewWithEcs: automatically renews the subscription dedicated hosts along with the subscription ECS instances hosted on the dedicated hosts.\n*   StopRenewWithEcs: does not automatically renew the subscription dedicated hosts along with the subscription ECS instances hosted on the dedicated hosts.\n*   NoOperation: does not change the current settings for the dedicated hosts.\n\n> If you set this parameter to AutoRenewWithEcs, make sure that `AutoRenew` is set to true to enable auto-renewal for the dedicated hosts. Otherwise, the subscription dedicated hosts are not automatically renewed along with the subscription ECS instances hosted on the dedicated hosts.\n\nDefault value: NoOperation.",
