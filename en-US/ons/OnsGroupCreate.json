The group ID cannot be the same as an existing group ID or topic name in ApsaraMQ for RocketMQ instances that belong to your Alibaba Cloud account.\n\n> \n\n*   After the consumer group is created, the group ID cannot be changed.\n\n*   To check whether an instance uses a namespace, log on to the ApsaraMQ for RocketMQ console, go to the **Instance Details** page, and then view the value of the Namespace field in the **Basic Information** section.",
